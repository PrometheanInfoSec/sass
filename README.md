Sass as a Service
=================

Have you seen those Spongebob memes that have been floating around the internet as of late?  The ones in which Spongebob is mocking things said to him in a goofy voice?

Yeah, so this a script that does that to people who try to hack you.

You set it to listen on a port, and then when someone thinks it's a vulnerable service, and attempts to "hack" in, it just sends them back whatever they sent it, in a mocking voice.


Have fun!
